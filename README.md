# artificial-neural-network

The goal is to learn how to create a basic neural network with numpy and train it on the MNIST dataset.
After I create it I'll play around with the "dials" (# of hidden layers, with/without biases, alpha values, triggers to end training, etc).

Bonus: I'll also create this neural network with pyTorch.
